Sampling-based optimal control for quadrotor trajectory tracking using learned dynamics

The final project for the course learning-based control for robotics. In this project, the performance of MPPI and CEM control
methods was analyzed using the learned quadrotor dynamics. Please refer to the pdf in the repo for more details.
